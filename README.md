# Regression-Analysis-of-sales-prices-for-a-wholesale-store
Regression analysis was performed to understand the trend between sale prices and the corresponding factors based on the previous research and identifying the significant regressor factors and to check for the possible interaction between the same. 

The report includes various regression techniques in order to achieve a satisfactory model to predict the sale prices in the future and take influential management decisions in order to increase the same. Various Regression techniques such as Multiple Regression, Model Accuracy Checking, diagnostics for outliers or influential points, indicator variables, handling multicollinearity, performing variable selection and model building and validation of the same are covered in the report. 

Additionally, the data being a time series data, there was a check for possible Autocorrelation in the model. Autocorrelation can be treated by addition of predictor variables or implementing various parameter estimation methods such as Cochrane-Orcutt method. Cochrane-Orcutt method was implemented to eliminate Autocorrelation and make the data set Uncorrelated. After making sure that the data is uncorrelated statistical analysis was performed for model validation and checked for outliers or influential points in the data set. 

Based on the final model and analysis ,certain recommendations are mentioned and possible ways to increase the accuracy of the model at the end of the report.
